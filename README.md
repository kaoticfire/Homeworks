# LanWebSite

A small website designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 3B but can be run on a Windows basoed system. This website serves as a central location for chore assignment and dinner ideas. The chores are assigned at random to two users who do not have the is_parent flag set to true. The site contains an Admin page for database management.  

## Roadmap  

Want to change the seperate SQL query for sorting the chores using the Flask-SQLAlchemy instead of the Sqlite connect module.
