# Homeworks

A small website designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 3B but can be run on a Windows basoed system. This website serves as a central location for chore assignment, dinner ideas, groceries, and messages (both private and general). The chores are assigned at random to users who do not have the is_parent flag set to true. The site contains an Admin page for database management.  

## Built With  

The website is built with the Flask framework, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Python.

## Roadmap  

Want to change the seperate SQL query for sorting the chores using the Flask-SQLAlchemy instead of the Sqlite connect module.
